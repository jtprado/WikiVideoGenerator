Hey followers - want to hear a fun fact about Boston? It might be known for baked beans and Harvard, but Beantown is also home to more world championships across all U.S. sports teams - like the Celtics, Bruins, and Patriots - than any other city. Wild, right?! Between that, the famous marathon and all the historic landmarks that fueled the American Revolution like the Tea Party site and Freedom Trail, this town is a pot of cultural and sports gold for the history nerd in all of us.  Obviously I'm barely scratching the surface! Get those plane tickets, girls - before the 12-foot sea level rise takes this coastal gem off the vacation list by 2100. Boston is definitely a city for your bucket list before this climate change gets any worse!

Let me know if you plan any Boston trips soon - I'd love to share tips from my time in college there!
