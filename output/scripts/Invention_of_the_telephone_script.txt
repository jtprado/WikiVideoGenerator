 "Dudes! Did you know that your phone is made possible by a bunch of nerdy inventors over 150 years ago? Guys like Meucci, Reis and Edison were tinkering with electric voice transmitters while Bell raced to put it all together and make the first call. 

Bell totally nailed it in 1876 with his simple receiver and transmitter that could send clear speech. Sending voices through wires probably blew minds back then. It was a total game changer.  

Bell even called his bud Watson who was 5 miles away! “Can you hear me now?” Ha! Bet Watson freaked.  

So next time you call your bros to grab a beer, remember it traces back to some 19th century inventors dropping science to make it happen. Mad props to those dudes! Maybe we'd all still be sending texts by carrier pigeon without them! Hashtag gamechanginginvention!"
